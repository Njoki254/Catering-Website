This website is created for a dummy catering company needing a website to get some more business. It was largely designed using Bootstrap. Pay attention to how the page is responsive right out of the box.
Some requirements it meets include:
The use of a container to house the page content.
Includes a jumbotron to display the company's name and slogan.
Used panels to hold the meals offered by the company.
Used helper classes to highlight and emphasize various parts of the page.
