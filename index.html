  <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
  <h1 class="visible-lg bg-success">We are an on-site and off-site catering company offering full food-service management
   to corporations, universities, museums, and specialty venues. We aim to spread the appreciation of African delicacies nationally and internationally.
   Based in Nairobi, Kenya. We've catered for more than 1,000 events since 2015. Our food is cooked from scratch, including sauces, stocks, and soups.
A pioneer in environmentally sound sourcing policies, we’ve developed programs addressing local purchasing, overuse of antibiotics, sustainable seafood, the food–climate change connection, humanely raised meat and eggs, and farmworkers’ rights. We’re grateful to have been recognized by many leading foundations, nonprofits, and industry associations for our work.
Our Dream is to be the premier onsite restaurant company known for its culinary expertise and commitment to socially responsible practices. We are a culture driven to create food that is alive with flavor and nutrition, prepared from scratch using authentic ingredients. We do this in a socially
responsible manner for the well-being of our guests, communities, and the environment..</h1>

<h2>LEADING BY EXAMPLE</h2>
<h1 class="hidden-xs bg-danger">WE'RE PROUD TO BE THE FIRST FOOD SERVICE COMPANY TO COMMIT TO:
Supporting local agriculture companywide, since 2012. Striving to serve only seafood that meets Seafood Watch sustainability guidelines, since 2013
Reducing antibiotic use in farm animals, since 2013 Switching to rBGH-free milk, since 2013.</h1>
<h2>SEEKING OUT SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD</h2>
<h1 class="hidden-sm bg-info">The Earth’s oceans are being emptied at a dizzying rate, and the aquaculture that has sprung up to replace wild fish
  on our plates comes with its own set of problems. We were the first food service company to address this crisis, and we’ve made the most comprehensive commitment to sustainable seafood of any national restaurant or food company to date. Supporting responsibly sourced seafood
  has become more than a food standard. It is part of our culture, part of who we are.</h1>
